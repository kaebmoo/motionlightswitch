Motion Detection and Light Sensor Switch

use arduino nano and PIR Sensor (PIR HC-SR501 ), LDR Photo resistor Sensor Module

LDR Analog pin connect to A0 (Analog 0-1024)

LDR Digital output connect to D6 (1 or 0)

PIR Output connect to Digital D3

PIR configuration at Digital D9. Enable PIR active by set D9 = LOW, pull up resistor to GND. or Disable motion detect by pull up resistor to VCC. when disable motion detect this switch is on when little light.
